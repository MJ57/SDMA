Life is good.  When you stop the bullshit.  I’m done with politics and trying to figure out whats politically correct. If I offend you then keep your ass out of my space.  And if you’ve not watched #Mandalorian you not being good to yourself.  #babyoda #peaceofmind pic.twitter.com/mCmjcE8jFy

"It's Sunday, so I think I should piss a few people off. 😬🙉
The #Mandalorian review: it's bad, nearly unwatchable, IMO. Plot is predictable, dialogue is stilted, cliche and OTN, the main character is boring.
I'm a huge SF fan (for 50yrs), but this #tvseries is one of the worst."
"Hey @Jon_Favreau , thanks for saving #starwars for us. #Mandalorian"
"This is the way.
